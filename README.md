The objective is to make a path using quadratic bezier curves, adding how many you need and changing it's extremities or it's control points. When ready, you can press the Button "Bezier Ball!" to watch a ball run the path you made.

There is a free play mode, where you can play and create curves freely, and the time attack mode, where you need to create a path that go through all the rings as fast as possible, and then make the ball pass inside each one of them without touching it's borders.

To play, just download the zipped folder and execute the .exe file.

Controls:

- Use WASD to move the camera while in free camera (won't work with tutorial tab open).
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out.
- If you want to move the camera without rotating, press the right mouse button once to freeze rotation. Press it again to release rotation.
- Use the mouse to click and drag the points.
- Press space to add a new bezier curve.
- Press bezier ball to unleash the ball through the path you made.

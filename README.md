# BezierBall
Bezier Ball is a little game made as the final project of UFRJ Computer Science computer graphics discipline.

The objective is to make a path using quadratic bezier curves, adding how many you need and changing it's extremities or it's control points. When ready, you can press the Button "Bezier Ball!" to watch a ball run the path you made.

There is a free play mode, where you can play and create curves freely, and the time attack mode, where you need to create a path that go through all the rings as fast as possible, and then make the ball pass inside each one of them without touching it's borders.

To play, just download the zipped folder and execute the .exe file.
